How does Kotlin works in Android?
- like Java, its code is compiled into bytecode and is executed by the JVM.
compiled Kotlin bytecode is 'Main.class' and the JVM executes it

What is 'Null safety' and 'Nullable types'? What is the 'Elvis operator'?
- Kotlin tries to prevent NPE by using nullable types like 'String?', 'Int?'
etc. These act as a wrapper type and can hold null values. To retrieve the
basic type we use safe calls that unwrap these nullable types.

We use Elvis operator to safety unwrap the value from a nullable type(?:).
The value on the right will be used if the nullable type is null

How many types of constructors are used on Kotlin?
- two: primary constructor - header of the class is declared after a class name
       secondary constructor - allows putting additional logic declared in the body of a class
