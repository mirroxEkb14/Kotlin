package dataTypes.equality.conversionJavaToKotlin

/**
 * Double-click on the Java class and select "Convert Java File to Kotlin File".
 * If we copy a Java class, right-click on the package and "paste", then convert
 * the class to a Kotlin class.
 * If we copy a part of the code, the IDE determines that it is Java code and
 * suggests converting it to a Kotlin code.
 * Sometimes after the conversion the code might be different, so it is important
 * to check the code
